    <h2><span>1. who am i</span></h2>
    <p>
      Hey, I'm Raj.  I am a Software Engineer with more than 5 years of professional experience.
      In my time as a developer, I've been able to work on a wide range of projects, enabling
      me to constantly learn new technologies while also pushing me to master core concepts
      of the developmental tools or languages I am adopting.
      I am passionate about building efficient, tailored applications focused on users and their needs.
      I get excited by the applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning to data and
      how those insights can fundamentally alter programs and companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 2013 with a Bachelors in Psychology and
      in 2014 with a Masters in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently live in San Francisco, CA and work remotely for Sparo,
      a biomedical tech start-up based in St. Louis, MO.

      <li>
        Implemented signal processing engine written in Python that transforms audio recordings of repiratory exhalations
        into lung function data. I also helped deploy this engine to AWS as part of a real-time application stack
        for Sparo's FDA-approved product <a href='https://mywing.io' target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wing</a>.

    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I like to spend my time away from the computer screen.
      I spend time with my dog Echo as her designated ball thrower and hiking companion.
      As a lifelong fan, I love to play and watch the soccer.
      I'm an avid chef who enjoys making his own pasta from scratch and learning the cooking techniques of different cultures.
