    <h2><span>1. who am i</span></h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Raj. I am a Software Engineer with more than 5 years of professional experience.
      As a developer, I've been able to work on a wide range of projects, enabling
      me to constantly learn new technologies while also pushing me to master core concepts
      of the developmental tools or languages I am adopting.
      I am passionate about building efficient, tailored applications focused on users and their needs.
      I get excited by the applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning to data and
      how those insights can enhance the impact of programs and companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 2013 with a Bachelor's in Psychology and
      again in 2014 with a Master's in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently live in San Francisco, CA and work remotely for Sparo,
      a biomedical tech start-up based in St. Louis, MO.

    <h2><span>2. experience</span></h2>
    <p>
      As a software engineer on a small team, I've enjoyed being self-reliant, creative, and
      collaborative as I design and develop efficient, reliable software for people with
      respiratory afflictions like asthma and COPD.
      I've been able to work on a number of different projects &ndash; often on an interdisciplinary team of co-workers &ndash; learning and using
      a variety of languages and tools along the way. Some of what I've done individually or collaboratively at Sparo are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Implemented a signal processing engine written in Python that transforms audio recordings of repiratory exhalations
        into lung function data. Also helped deploy this engine to AWS as part of a real-time application stack
        for Sparo's FDA-approved product <a href='https://mywing.io' target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wing</a>.

          <span class='tag'>aws</span>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborated with other developers to create a React.js web app built for user management and administration,
        orchestrating builds and deployments using CircleCI and Docker.

        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Trained a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow to classify user data and created
        a pre-processing pipeline to tag and manage labeled data sets.

      <li>
        Worked with a team using Google Firebase as a backend to build Sparo's online education platform called
        <a href='https://liftpulmonaryrehab.com' target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Lift</a>,
        where COPD patients can enroll in wellness and breathing classes.

    <h2><span>4. interests</span></h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I like to spend my time away from the computer screen.
      I play with my dog Echo as her designated ball-thrower and hiking companion.
      As a lifelong fan, I love to play and watch soccer, particularly Arsenal Football Club.
      I'm an avid and self-taught chef who enjoys making his own pasta from scratch and
      learning cooking techniques from different cultures.
